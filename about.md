I come from a small farming town called Warwick in the state of New York (USA). I attended the State University of New York (SUNY) Geneseo where I majored in Physics with a minor in Mathematics. I actually wanted to double-minor in Chemistry, but that was a short-lived endeavour after encountering Organic Chemistry...

During my time studying physics, I maintained my passion for software development, taking every opportunity I could to contributed useful software solutions for my classes and research. After an eye-opening research experience in Taiwan, I decided to go for my Masters degree abroad.

I moved to Paris, France in 2014 after receiving my Bachelor's degree to attend the Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie in hopes of attaining a Masters in Computational Physics. As part of finishing my M1 degree in the field, I began working as an intern at Business & Decision Group in October 2017. During that time, I designed a state-of-the-art interior positioning system that uses Deep Learning techniques to localize entities in indoor environments. I was hired as a full-time Data Scientist and R&D Software Engineer immediately upon completion of the internship.

I got to continue my work on the Indoor Geolocation project I had started, and I also got to work on some very cool data science consulting projects; I worked on things like fraud detection and rare-event prediction, as well the more traditional classification tasks. I really got to cut my teeth on the harder parts of being a data scientist (data cleansing, model cross validation, unbalanced data sets, sampling techniques, etc.), and learned very quickly that there is more to it than the simple examples online.

I also chose to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science & Digital Marketing at HETIC Grand Ecole in Paris; I finished a MSc. curriuclum in one year, and am expecting a my degree with honors. My thesis was a group project where I worked in a team of two technical students (data scientists) and three MBA students to create a lean technology startup. We ended up getting a client using our platform! Unfortunately, our 1-customer revenue was *exactly* offset by the AWS infrastructure costs of the product. We broke even.

Today, machine learning, deep learning, and developing software in the cloud (with AWS) are what I dedicate most of my time to learning about. I hope to use this page as a place to blog about new experiences, new avenues of research, and even tutorials for fellow software developers.
