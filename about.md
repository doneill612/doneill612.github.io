I come from a small farming town called Warwick in the state of New York (USA).
After completing my high school diploma I attended the State University of New York (SUNY) Geneseo where I majored in Physics with a minor in Mathematics. I actually wanted to double-minor in Chemistry, but that was a short-lived endeavour after encountering Organic Chemistry...

During my time studying physics, I maintained my passion for software development, taking every opportunity I could to contribute tangible, useful software solutions to be used in my classes and research. After an eye-opening research experience in Taiwan, I decided to go for my Masters degree abroad.
I moved to Paris, France in 2014 after receiving my Bachelor's degree to attend the Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie. I'm currently pursuing two degrees - Astrophysics and Computational Physics (let's just call that Computer Science). I finished an internship at Business & Decision Group in October 2017 during which I designed a state-of-the-art interior positioning system that uses Deep Learning techniques to localize entities in indoor environments. Since then, I've joined Business & Decision as a Datascience / Innovation Engineer and Consultant. I'm currently consulting for one of our main clients, Le Groupe La Poste.

Although Physics will always be a strong passion of mine, new technologies related to the Internet of Things, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are what I dedicate most of my time to learning about. I hope to use this page as a place to blog about new experiences, new avenues of research, and even tutorials for fellow software developers.
